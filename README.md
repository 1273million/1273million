## Hi there 👋
I am an amateur coder, intermediate bass clarinetist, and student, currently in the Minneapolis, MN metro area.

I am not well versed in code at all, and I only learned how to code up patches for a game I play because I liked the game enough to learn coding.

I am a Linux user (Ubuntu with KDE, ver. 25.10), and prefer everything to be free/open source when available.

I can be reached by [my Gmail account](mailto://1273million@gmail.com), and that's pretty much it.
